6306 Unit 5 assignment
I was able to load the library for repmis
But Gandrud's dropbox URL has changed.
I found his new one but not the data set.

As far as Dr McGee's repository, I was able to 
"fork" it into my profile.
Git is taking a long time to install to my 
desktop for some reason. I will update this
file if it finally installs and I can push
files to this repository from my laptop.
